Personal Takeaways

Studying this case reinforced how thoughtful data and consulting frameworks bring measurable business outcomes. 
It inspired me to see beyond dashboards and focus on real-world customer impact and cross-functional collaboration.

Professional Lessons

When designing solutions, think end-to-end: upstream (pricing/brand) through downstream (claims/servicing).
Multi-brand + omnichannel = modern distribution playbook in insurance and similar industries.
Process intelligence (mining, mapping) is under-used but high-impact during transformation.
Sustained success comes from aligning people + systems + metrics—not just deploying new tools.
A well-structured case study becomes transferable: take the model here and apply it to other industries and contexts.
